when 3 minor triad or 3m7 appears in a progression, it is a substitute (tonic function) for the 1 chord which is usually a maj6 or maj7 chord. When Phrygian is played over the 3 minor or 3m7 chord the second and sixth scale degrees sound dissonant and need to be resolved to the root and the 5th. Phrygian usually playerd over a dominant chord with suspended fourth and a flatted ninth(with possible flatted thirteens) When utilised in that function it no longer function as tonic chord but rather as a dominant altered chord type which can resolve down a fifth (up a fourth) to a 1 chord in major or minor harmony

When played over dominant 7th chord structures which contain a major third special care must be given to 4th scale degree which is dissonant and needs to be resolved to the 3rd which is half step below. Chords usually function as 5 chord in a major key but also found serving as a 1 (tonic) and 4 (sub-dom) in a blues type progresssions.

Chords are common being the major7#5. When played over the following chord structure special care must be given to the sixth scale degree which is dissonant and needs to be resolved to the fifth which is half step below. Like Lydian mode Lydian augmented chords are also used as substitude to a tonic major chords.

Most common chords is b6 chord type. Chords are usually dominant 7th or dominant 7thsus4 structures

When scale si played over dominant 7th chord that contain a major third and a perfect fifth special care must be given to the fourth and sixth scale degree, which are dissonant and need to be resolved to the third and fifth respectively. The dominant 9sus4(b13) chord which can replace a dom7sus4 is sometimes interpreted as a minor 6(2nd inversion or a minor 7b5/3rd inversion) and is odten found serving as a 4min. 6 in a major key.

If we construct chords from this scale entirely based on thirds we arrive at fully extended minor 7b5 chord with a b9th, b11th, b13th. b11th in this scale is really the same enharmonically as aa major third, When a mode has two thirds sach as minor third and major third , the major is considered the true third while the minor third is interpreted sharped(augmented) ninth, When reordered the scale creates a dominant 7th chord structure with a b5/#11 #5/b13, b9, #9. Altered dominant chords tipically resolve to chords whose roots lie in perfect fifth bellow, onee half step above or a major third below, Athough it is most commonly found functioning as V7 in major or minor harmony it can be found in other positions as well. Six common posisions are as follows

positions: III7, bV7, V7, bVI7, VI7, VII7
