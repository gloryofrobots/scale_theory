Whole-Half

Formula: 1 2 b3 4 #4 #5 6 7

Chords
======

Because it is a symmetric scale it can not be related to a key, but since diminished 7th chord
is found only on the seventh degree of the harmonic minor scales
the diminished chord (with its acailable extensions) derived from
the whole-half diminished would function in the same capacity. Diminished 7th chords typically
function as rootless dominant chords resolving to a chord whose root is located
a half step above in either a major or minor tonality.
Chords built in this scale are interchangeable.


 * Cdim7 [ 8 x 7 8 7 x] [x 3 4 2 4 x] Altered bb7 

Diminished 7th hord are often extended to include one or more of the
non-chord tones from the diminished scale. When these chords appear in the printed form,
they are often written as "add" chords such as Cdim7(add maj7), or Cdim7(add D), etc.
Available extensions

Dim7(Cdim7) -- Major 7th(B) --  Major 9th(D) -- Perfect 11th(F) -- Minor 13th(Ab)

Chords
======

Most common chords is dominant 7th altered chord structures.
When a mode has two thirds such as a mojor third and minor third, the major
third is onsidered the true third while the minor third is interpreted as a
sharped (augmented) ninth. The exception to this rule is mode VII of harmonic minor
or altered bb7, which is not an extremely common chord scale used in improvisation
When the half-whole scale is used it creates a doninant 7th chord structure with a
b9, a #9, a #11, and a natural 13. Chords built in this scale are interchangeable
Chords typically resolve to chords whose roots lie a perfect fifth below.

 * C7b9 [8 x 8 9 8 9] [x 3 2 3 2 3] 

 * C13b9 [8 x 8 9 10 9] [x 3 2 3 2 5]


Whole Tone
++++++++++

Formula: 1 2 3 #4 #5 b7

This scale has six notes and because of it there are 2 identical groups of scale
 * C D E F# G# Bb
 * Db Eb F G A B

Chords
======

Most common chord is dominant 7#5 chord. Whole tone chords
are built upon the principles of symmetry and therefor are in interchangeable.
Scale can nit be related to a key, but since altered dominant chords typically
resolve to chords are located a fifth below, whole tone chords function in the same capacity

 * C7#5 [8 x 8 9 9 x] [x 3 6 3 5 x]

 * C9#5 [8 7 8 7 9 x] [x 3 2 3 3 4]
