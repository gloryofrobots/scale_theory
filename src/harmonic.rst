Chords
======

Most common being diminished 7th, or fully diminished chord.
Special care : II <- I, IV <- III. Since the dim. 7th chord is built on the
7th degree (leading tone)) of a harmonic minor it has dominant function typically
resolving to a chord whose root located in half step above, in either major or minor
tonality. It should be noted that due to its symmetric chord makeup any one of the tones
in the dim.7th can serve as root of the chord thereby allowing this chord to have various
resolutions. the most common functions of the dim. 7th chord si to substitute
for a dominant 7b9 chord whose root lies in a majot third below.
