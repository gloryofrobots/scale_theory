Phrygian
++++++++

Formula: **1 b2 b3 4 5 b6 b7**

Chords
======

When 3 minor triad or 3m7 appears in a progression,
it is a substitute (tonic function) for the 1 chord which is usually a maj6 or maj7 chord.
When Phrygian is played over the 3 minor or 3m7 chord the second
and sixth scale degrees sound dissonant and need to be resolved to the root and the 5th.
Phrygian usually playerd over a dominant chord with suspended fourth and a flatted ninth
(with possible flatted thirteens) When utilised in that function it no longer function
as tonic chord but rather as a dominant altered chord type which can resolve down
a fifth (up a fourth) to a 1 chord in major or minor harmony
