is sometimes interpreted as a minor 6(2nd inversion or a minor 7b5/3rd inversion)
and is odten found serving as a 4min. 6 in a major key.

Altered scale 
+++++++++++++

Alias: **Diminished Whole Tone Altered Dominant, Pomeroy, Ravel**

Formula: **1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7**

Chords
======

If we construct chords from this scale entirely based on thirds
we arrive at fully extended minor 7b5 chord with a b9th, b11th, b13th. b11th
in this scale is really the same enharmonically as aa major third,
When a mode has two thirds sach as minor third and major third ,
the major is considered the true third while the minor third is
interpreted sharped(augmented) ninth, When reordered the scale creates
a dominant 7th chord structure with a b5/#11 #5/b13, b9, #9.
Altered dominant chords tipically resolve to chords whose roots
lie in perfect fifth bellow, one half step above or a major third below,
Athough it is most commonly found functioning as V7 in major or
minor harmony it can be found in other positions as well.
Six common posisions are as follows

positions: III7, bV7, V7, bVI7, VI7, VII7

 * C7b9b5 [8 x 8 9 7 9] [x 3 2 3 2 2]
 * C7#9b5 [8 7 8 8 7 x] [x 3 2 3 4 2]
 * C7b9#5 [8 x 8 9 9 9] [x 3 2 3 2 4]
 * C7#9#5 [8 x 8 9 9 11] [x 3 2 3 4 4]
